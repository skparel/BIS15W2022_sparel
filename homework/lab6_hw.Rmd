## Instructions
Answer the following questions and complete the exercises in RMarkdown. Please embed all of your code and push your final work to your repository. Your final lab report should be organized, clean, and run free from errors. Remember, you must remove the `#` for the included code chunks to run. Be sure to add your name to the author header above.  

Make sure to use the formatting conventions of RMarkdown to make your report neat and clean!  

## Load the libraries
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(skimr)
```

For this assignment we are going to work with a large data set from the [United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization](http://www.fao.org/about/en/) on world fisheries. These data are pretty wild, so we need to do some cleaning. First, load the data.  

Load the data `FAO_1950to2012_111914.csv` as a new object titled `fisheries`.
```{r}
fisheries <- readr::read_csv(file = "../lab6/data/FAO_1950to2012_111914.csv")
```

1. Do an exploratory analysis of the data (your choice). What are the names of the variables, what are the dimensions, are there any NA's, what are the classes of the variables?  

The names of the variables, dimensions, and counts of NA's are reported in the summary below. The variables with NA's are characters.
```{r}
fisheries %>% skim()
```


2. Use `janitor` to rename the columns and make them easier to use. As part of this cleaning step, change `country`, `isscaap_group_number`, `asfis_species_number`, and `fao_major_fishing_area` to data class factor. 
```{r}
fisheries <- fisheries %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(across(c(country, isscaap_group_number, asfis_species_number, fao_major_fishing_area), as.factor))
```


We need to deal with the years because they are being treated as characters and start with an X. We also have the problem that the column names that are years actually represent data. We haven't discussed tidy data yet, so here is some help. You should run this ugly chunk to transform the data for the rest of the homework. It will only work if you have used janitor to rename the variables in question 2!
```{r}
fisheries_tidy <- fisheries %>% 
  pivot_longer(-c(country,common_name,isscaap_group_number,isscaap_taxonomic_group,asfis_species_number,asfis_species_name,fao_major_fishing_area,measure),
               names_to = "year",
               values_to = "catch",
               values_drop_na = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(year= as.numeric(str_replace(year, 'x', ''))) %>% 
  mutate(catch= str_replace(catch, c(' F'), replacement = '')) %>% 
  mutate(catch= str_replace(catch, c('...'), replacement = '')) %>% 
  mutate(catch= str_replace(catch, c('-'), replacement = '')) %>% 
  mutate(catch= str_replace(catch, c('0 0'), replacement = ''))

fisheries_tidy$catch <- as.numeric(fisheries_tidy$catch)
```

3. How many countries are represented in the data? Provide a count and list their names.

203 countries are represented in the data. A list of the countries represented and the number of observations associated with each country is reported below.

```{r}
fisheries_tidy %>% 
  count(country)
```

4. Refocus the data only to include country, isscaap_taxonomic_group, asfis_species_name, asfis_species_number, year, catch.
```{r}
fisheries_tidy2 <- fisheries_tidy %>% 
  select(country, isscaap_taxonomic_group, asfis_species_name, asfis_species_number, year, catch)
```

5. Based on the asfis_species_number, how many distinct fish species were caught as part of these data?

Based on the asfis_species_number, 1551 distinct fish species were caught.
```{r}
fisheries_tidy2 %>% 
  summarize(distinct_species = n_distinct(asfis_species_number))
```

6. Which country had the largest overall catch in the year 2000?

China had the largest overall catch of a single species in the year 2000.
```{r}
fisheries_tidy2 %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(catch), year == "2000") %>% 
  summarize(largest_overall_catch = max(catch)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(largest_overall_catch))
```
China also had the largest catch across all species in the year 2000.
```{r}
fisheries_tidy2 %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(catch), year == "2000") %>% 
  summarize(largest_overall_catch = sum(catch)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(largest_overall_catch))
```

7. Which country caught the most sardines (_Sardina pilchardus_) between the years 1990-2000?

Morocco caught the most sardines between the years 1990 - 2000.
```{r}
fisheries_tidy2 %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(catch), 
         between(year, "1990", "2000"), 
         asfis_species_name == "Sardina pilchardus") %>% 
  summarize(sardines_caught = sum(catch)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(sardines_caught))
```

8. Which five countries caught the most cephalopods between 2008-2012?

Cephalopods are recorded in `isscaap_taxonomic_group` as "Squids, cuttlefishes, octopuses".
```{r}
fisheries_tidy2$isscaap_taxonomic_group %>% unique()
```
The 5 countries which caught the most cephalopods between 2008 - 2012 are reported below.
```{r}
fisheries_tidy2 %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(catch), 
         isscaap_taxonomic_group == "Squids, cuttlefishes, octopuses", 
         between(year, "2008", "2012")) %>% 
  summarize(cephalopods_caught = sum(catch)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(cephalopods_caught)) %>% 
  head(5)
```

9. Which species had the highest catch total between 2008-2012? (hint: Osteichthyes is not a species)

_Theragra chalcogramma_ had the highest catch total between 2008 - 2012.
```{r}
fisheries_tidy2 %>% 
  group_by(asfis_species_name) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(catch), 
         between(year, "2008", "2012"), 
         asfis_species_name != "Osteichthyes") %>% 
  summarize(catch_total = sum(catch)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(catch_total))
```

10. Use the data to do at least one analysis of your choice.

Were more shrimps and prawns caught in the United States in 2000 or in 2010?
```{r}
# shrimps and prawns caught in 2000
fisheries_tidy2 %>% 
  filter(!is.na(catch), 
         year == 2000, 
         isscaap_taxonomic_group == "Shrimps, prawns",
         country == "United States of America") %>% 
  summarize(catch_total = sum(catch))
```
```{r}
# shrimps and prawns caught in 2010
fisheries_tidy2 %>% 
  filter(!is.na(catch), 
         year == 2010, 
         isscaap_taxonomic_group == "Shrimps, prawns",
         country == "United States of America") %>% 
  summarize(catch_total = sum(catch))
```
More shrimps and prawns were caught in 2000.
